# Hub-O-Matic

Hub-O-Matic is a utility for distributing and auto-updating non-sandboxed macOS 11 apps. It aims to make developing and deploying native macOS SwiftUI applications as painless as other non-native frameworks.

The Hub-O-Matic family consists of:

* [HubOMatic](https://github.com/hubomatic/HubOMatic): Swift package containing functionality to install updates from GitHub releases, as well as SwiftUI components for configuring and interacting with users.
* [hubomat](https://github.com/hubomatic/hubomat): GitHub Action for automatically archiving, signing, notarizing, and releasing a stand-alone macOS app.
* [MicroVector](https://github.com/hubomatic/MicroVector): Small sample app that demonstrates HubOMatic. It is designed to be forked and used as a template for other SwiftUI apps.

This project is in the very early stages, but contributions are welcome!
